DDD disrupts the mind-body connection and is marked by a pervasive sense of disembodiment and identity fragmentation. Symptoms stemming from untreated CSA tend to intensify over time, emphasizing the need for therapeutic interventions that address both psychological and physiological dimensions of trauma. Dance/movement therapy (DMT) offers a promising, body-centered approach that can help restore the mind-body connection, autonomy, and self-awareness disrupted by trauma. This review examines the potential of DMT to alleviate the neurobiological and emotional impacts of CSA-induced DDD and argues for its greater integration into trauma-informed treatment models. By targeting the embodied nature of dissociation, DMT may fill a critical gap in current therapeutic practices for this underdiagnosed and often misunderstood disorder.

It has been assumed that the excessive prescription of antibiotic medicines has produced antibacterial-resistant pathogenic bacterial populations. The growing concern about antibiotic- resistant bacteria has focused research efforts on naturally occurring phytochemicals. In addition to the traditional use of phytochemicals for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, these compounds have also been found to exhibit bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties. Research has revealed groups of bioactive compounds, termed secondary metabolites, that protect plants against environmental pathogens like herbivores, fungi, and bacteria. Groups of secondary metabolites have been found to inhibit bacterial growth, proving potential use as antibiotic medicines for humans in response to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Secondary metabolites like alkaloids and groups of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, have been isolated and tested for antibiotic properties in vitro. While phytochemicals individually display successful bacterial inhibition, combination therapies using secondary metabolites with currently distributed antibiotics seem to have synergistic bactericidal effects worth further research. The creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) is one plant that contains secondary metabolites that may serve as future antibiotic medicine for humans. Further development into the isolation of bioactive compounds can offer novel treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in humans.

Within the history of the archipelago, the Philippines has experienced generations of colonial presence, violence, and the loss of cultural identity. As a result, members of the Filipino community in the status quo may feel motivated to stifle their Filipino heritage out of shame and self-preservation, because the Philippines has historically been treated and perceived as inferior, or a means to an end. One of the ways that colonial mentality has manifested itself is in the skin whitening industry, in which products containing certain ingredients decrease the amount of melanin present in the skin. However, the skin whitening industry has become a public health crisis, disproportionately affecting women across the diaspora by establishing Eurocentric beauty standards. This interdisciplinary reflection will consider the disciplines of history, economics, and sociology to understand how colonial mentality within a Filipina experience has perpetuated itself, and help discover a path toward empowerment within personal ethnic identity.

Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment with open-heartedness and non-judgmental awareness. Existing literature suggests that mindfulness is linked to reduced stress and improved well-being. This study investigates the relationship between mindfulness, locus of control, and stress in college students. The study, conducted at a Christian university, employs a correlational design with 126 undergraduate participants. Two Pearson’s r correlational analyses were used to assess the relation- ships between mindfulness and stress and mindfulness and locus of control. Results indicate a negative correlation between mindfulness and stress (r = -.414, p = <.001) and between mindfulness and locus of control (r = -.181, p = .043), supporting the hypothesis that higher levels of mindfulness relate to lower levels of stress and a stronger internal locus of control in college students. Limitations include the use of self-report measures and potential sampling bias from a single university. Future research should incorporate diverse samples from other universities and experimental designs to enhance generalizability and establish causation. The findings support the hypothesis and align with existing literature, emphasizing the potential benefits of mindfulness practices for stress reduction and the development of internal locus of control. Implications for mindfulness interventions to enhance students’ well-being are discussed, and avenues for future research are suggested. Jeremy Varnadore, Ashley Larson, Sean K.

For over twenty years, emergent bilingual students in Arizona have struggled under the state’s English-only policy. Despite the lack of research supporting its effectiveness in promoting English acquisition, this educational model continues to be enforced in Arizona classrooms. This reflections explores whether Arizona’s Proposition 203 was ever designed considering the “best interest” of Arizona’s emergent bilingual population or if its foundation was built under a false premise of “helping” to perpetuate specific ideals. Through this reflective piece, I bridge disciplinary boundaries by integrating theoretical frameworks across the disciplines of history, education, and psychology to examine the efficacy of Proposition 203 in addressing the complexities of language acquisition and the academic success of English Language Learners (ELLs). By drawing comparisons to other instructional methods employed in other unique student populations, this reflection provides a unique interdisciplinary perspective and a multifaceted approach that can help educators and policymakers address the current practices and existing programs impacting ELL students in Arizona.

The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast the behaviors and outcomes of modern leadership styles with that of DT leaders. The paper will also outline potential interventions for fixing adverse behaviors accompanying DT personality traits. When examining the literature, many authors comment on the effective and ineffective aspects of DT leadership, but they lack comprehensive interventions for dealing with leaders who exhibit DT personality traits and behaviors. It is of paramount importance to understand, intervene, and decrease these traits and behaviors in the workplace to boost the overall emotional, psychological, and physical safety of leaders, teams, and corporations. Exploring this could fuel more awareness of dark leader triads and potential interventions instead of merely exploring how these traits are exhibited in leadership or the workplace. This will enable more productivity and well-being in workplaces across the United States.

Current literature posits that accommodations for neurodivergent students in the education system are insufficient and ineffective (Nieminen, 2023). New models that focus on holistic accommodations have been proposed, integrating the teacher, fellow students, and the classroom environment into the neurodivergent learning process. These new holistic models were analyzed to understand them better and to ensure they match past and current research on neurodivergent populations. Most importantly, these models demonstrate the importance of individualizing instruction for each student, a practice strongly supported by current research. This paper also offers recommendations on how to fill the gaps in the current research, such as a lack of longitudinal studies. In addition, this paper recommends a new model for neurodivergent accommodation research called condition-specific individualization, which isa more effective framework for developing accommodation strategies. This model addresses accommodations and condition knowledge issues in classrooms attempting to accommodate neurodivergent students. Furthermore, this model recommends research into whether certain neurodivergent disorders are more receptive to certain forms of accommodation. Such research would allow for key individualization, while also recognizing that classrooms cannot always individualize to the degree recommended by current research. Through this analysis and these recommendations, this paper aims to create more effective neurodivergent accommodation models. Colin J. O’Reilly, Brynn E. Brunswig, Megan McConnell, Piper R.

Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation are all associated with this disease, and their interconnectivity in causing the development is still being investigated. The accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species from lipid peroxidation and macromolecule oxidation is thought to be responsible for oxidative stress’s effects. The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis suggests that amyloid beta plaques form due to the loss of mitochondrial function. This leads to abnormal expression of machinery involved with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and contributes to the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid β accumulation harms synapses and impairs neuronal transmission, causing neuronal pathway deterioration. Recent studies indicate that resveratrol, a polyphenol compound found in several plant species and fruits, may have therapeutic potential in treating Alzheimer’s disease by reducing oxidative stress and plaque pathology. Resveratrol is thought to inhibit several inflammatory and other neurotoxic pathways that serve to cause apoptosis and neuronal communication blockage in the CNS. However, additional research is necessary to fully comprehend the benefits of resveratrol and other polyphenols for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. Brayden J. Lamm, Jessica M. Buselmeier, Lorien R.

  { id: 1762395795954, title: "Deepfake Detection Via Facial Feature Extraction and Modeling – GCU Research", content: "The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while requiring fewer parameters.

  { id: 1762395853872, title: "The Great Commission: Effects of Evangelism on the Christian – GCU Research", content: "Upon engaging in several trips focusing on evangelism, I experienced an unexpected change. I noticed that after evangelizing, I had become significantly more compassionate and passionate about my faith. In order to discern the cause of these newfound changes, I looked at three theories to provide insight. The first theory focused on confirmation bias, the second on exposure, and the third on active faith. Using these three theories, I analyzed how witnessing someone convert to Christianity after sharing the Gospel with them could have brought about the unexpected changes. I concluded that while confirmation bias and exposure could have played a small role in my unexpected change, the most plausible explanation stemmed from employing active faith. Confirmation bias and exposure have evidence supporting them; however, I reasoned that they did not possess enough power to change my heart into one of compassion and zeal from the former one that was arrogant and complacent. The evidence seemed to support the idea that only a force as powerful as God could have brought about these unexpected changes. As a result of my reflection on my experience, my faith and confidence in God grew.

There are many factors in producing a successful transition program, but understanding barriers faced by student-athletes is the first step. These barriers may include negative stereotypes, mental health issues, physical burnout, and much more. Analyzing the sufficiency of current programs allows for future developments and improvements to be made while also acknowledging areas for improvement. Research on active programs is limited, but sufficient evidence exists to produce guidelines based on need. Recommendations are provided for coaches and support staff to assist student-athletes in their adjustment to college life, both in athletics and academics. The goal of these programs is not simply to elevate athletic performance during peak years of college, but to build skills in individuals which will translate to all areas of life, including careers after college.

  { id: 1762396231225, title: "The Invisible Workforce: An Interdisciplinary Analysis of Labor Trafficking – GCU Research", content: "Human trafficking does not always look like a locked room—it can look like a job. Labor trafficking is embedded in the economy and our daily lives. While sex trafficking dominates headlines, labor trafficking fuels industries in ways we fail to see. From 2011 to 2022, 17 U.S. states reported no labor trafficking arrests, highlighting severe enforcement gaps and neglect in victim identification (Dominguez et al., 2024). Labor trafficking remains large and undetected due to misinformed public perceptions and a lack of victim identification training in law enforcement. This paper explores the often-overlooked issue of labor trafficking, using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates law, economics, and sociology. This approach highlights the gaps in current anti-trafficking policies and argues that addressing labor trafficking requires a shift from a criminal justice-centered response to a broader strategy, utilizing economics and sociology to implement victim support systems and economic deterrence in industries. By expanding the scope of anti-trafficking efforts to include greater support for law enforcement, alongside corporate accountability and victim protections, more sustainable solutions that protect vulnerable workers and disrupt exploitative systems can occur.

By focusing on the legal constraints, economic hardships, lack of opportunities and resources, lack of familial support as first-generation students, and institutional responses, the review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the obstacles this unique population faces. Specific attention is placed on the impact of legal constraints, economic standing, and institutional practices. This literature review reveals that undocumented scholars pursuing a graduate education face a myriad of challenges stemming from their immigration status, which is followed by legal restrictions and financial hardships. The findings suggest that undocumented individuals encounter difficulties accessing financial aid at both state and federal levels. Undocumented individuals also face challenges as they seek internships, licensure, and employment within their field of study. These challenges impact academic achievement, long-term career prospects, and overall well-being. The literature reveals the need for future research to explore underrepresented demographics and to shift focus to individuals who are not DACA-eligible. This shift is necessary to create inclusive policies and institutional initiatives that support the specific needs of undocumented graduate students.

It explores the history of mindfulness and theories of mindfulness, including self-determination theory, mindfulness-to-meaning theory, and dispositional mindfulness. The review examines mindfulness’s neurological, biological, psychological, and emotional impacts based on current research. It examines mindfulness interventions and their effectiveness in reducing stress in populations among students, working professionals, and clients undergoing clinical treatment. Studies show mindfulness can lower stress levels, though the impacts vary between populations. Mindfulness is also linked to improvements in behaviors, emotions, and well-being. Meditation practices, including meditation, yoga, and breathing techniques, positively affect biological, psychological, and emotional well-being. As mindfulness continues to expand in the realm of psychology, there is an ongoing opportunity for refining and enhancing interventions. Future research should evaluate the efficacy of novel mindfulness techniques and explore the application of mindfulness in previously unexplored populations, including college students.

As modern work environments continue to evolve, factors such as job insecurity, excessive job demands, and managerial influences have been identified as primary contributors to stress in the workplace. Research indicates that prolonged exposure to these stressors leads to adverse psychological and physical outcomes, decreased job satisfaction, and diminished career performance. Additionally, social factors, including peer relationships and organizational culture, are crucial in moderating stress levels among employees. While some studies suggest that moderate stress can enhance productivity in certain situations, chronic stress has been widely linked to burnout, reduced efficiency, and higher turnover rates. This literature review examines the relationship between workplace stress and job performance while also exploring evidence-based interventions designed to mitigate stress-related consequences. Strategies such as physical activity, mindfulness practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing stress and improving employee outcomes. However, gaps remain in the current research, particularly concerning the impact of workplace stress on blue-collar workers, self-report measures, longitudinal data, and the long-term sustainability of intervention programs. By synthesizing existing findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of workplace stress and its implications, offering insights into strategies that can enhance employee well-being and organizational effectiveness.

Despite the attempt to help address the barriers faced by this student population, the generalization of the term “first-gen” limits the capacity to grasp how specific identities, such as those pertaining to immigration status, may impact a student’s educational opportunities. Undocumented and DACA students face unique challenges in their pursuit of higher education. They often are more vulnerable to additional barriers and stressors due to the ambiguous nature surrounding immigration and education policy in the United States. Barriers for this subgroup of first-gen students include access to state and federal-based financial aid and in-state tuition rates, including a knowledge barrier in understanding the process of attaining post-secondary education. To help combat these obstacles, I developed programming under three overarching concepts: co-learning, supporting, and providing, which aimed to cultivate strong support systems and resources for student success. Thus, this community engagement profile focuses on how I addressed these barriers as the Immigrant Scholarship Hustle program fellow in my caseload of seven undocumented high school students through three applied methods, including student-parent orientation, educational workshops, and yearlong mentorship.

This interdisciplinary reflection builds on existing research about how social stigma affects treatment adherence for patients with bipolar disorder. This reflection examines the disciplines of sociology and psychology within the context of how these disciplines can be combined to improve treatment adherence and overall quality of life for these patients. Symbolic interactionism and cognitive behavioral theory are introduced to explore how social constructs influence behavior and thought processes, leading to non-adherence to traditional treatment methods. Through compiling scholarly research on current treatment adherence rates, treatment methods, relevant social factors, and cultural representations of psychiatric disorders, this reflection analyzes how these concepts affect bipolar disorder treatment. The results of this research indicate that many patients with bipolar disorder struggle to maintain their treatment due to a lack of internal motivation, which is often worsened by unsupportive environments and negative social experiences. These results demonstrate how combining disciplines can improve treatment adherence by integrating socially conscious methods like motivational interviewing and psychoeducation into current treatment. By continuing to increase awareness of the interdisciplinary approach among professionals to include both social and psychological aspects of treatment, the human element is reintroduced and allows the patient’s individual story to be heard.

Benefits include reduction of stress, anxiety, and other psychopathological symptoms. Additionally, mindfulness has positive effects on academic performance in the way that it enhances a student’s ability to sustain attention and retain information more efficiently. Literature on the adverse effects of mindfulness, such as retraumatization, delusions, and anxiety, are also mentioned to remove bias. With the growing popularity of mindfulness, this study aims to understand mindfulness within the contexts of education and faith. In hopes of integrating mindfulness practice into a Christian based university, we researched the benefits of mindfulness in educational settings ranging from primary to higher education, as well as mindfulness from the perspective of the Christian faith. Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of mindfulness for the Christian faith, but they do not incorporate education in their methods. To our knowledge, no conclusive study exists on the intersection between faith, education, and mindfulness. Findings indicate that implementing acts of mindfulness improves attention span, ability to retain information, and cognitive control. Vanessa J. Alba, Alexa R. Cherne-Evans, Dominick A.

The first theory postulates that the instruction and encouragement of my research mentor was the primary driver of the internship results. The second theory states that the condensed structure of the program created the optimal conditions for accelerated learning. The third theory cites personal drive and work ethic as the main rationale behind the results. Ultimately, I decided that the main contributing factor to the success of the internship was the mentorship that I received.

Regular self-weighing can aid weight management but may also contribute to weight cycling (repeated weight loss and regain), which has negative health impacts. This study examined the relationship between weighing frequency and weight cycling in post-COVID college students. This was an observational, correlational study with 124 college students aged 18-30 years. Participants completed the Weight and Lifestyle Inventory questionnaire assessing weight history, including weight cycling (≥ 10lb weight change) and weighing frequency. Anthropometrics were measured. Statistical analysis included t-tests, correlations, and ANOVA. Results showed that participants averaged 1.2 ± 1.4 weight cycles. Males weighed themselves more frequently than females (p = 0.004). When analyzing both genders, there was a significant positive correlation between weighing frequency and the number of weight cycles (r = 0.293, p = 0.006), which remained for males (r = 0.409, p = 0.005) but not for females. Those weighing daily had significantly more weight cycles than less frequent weighers (p < 0.05). More frequent weighing was associated with greater weight cycling, particularly among males. This contradicts some prior research suggesting the benefits of regular self-weighing for weight control. Potential limitations include the observational design, self-reported data, and sample demographics. Future research could explore psychological factors and employ longitudinal designs to establish causality and develop tailored interventions.

It was not until the early 2000s and more recent years that research started getting produced about the parasite and how it alters behavior. Recent studies have shown that Toxoplasma gondii can cause significant damage to brain regions, specifically the amygdala and the cerebral cortex (Ihara et al., 2016). Research findings have shown a correlation between infection with the parasite and aggression, suicidal ideation, intermittent explosive disorder, road rage, neuropsychiatric disorders, altered behavior, and personality changes (Coccaro et al., 2016; Desmettre, 2020).
