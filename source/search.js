DDD disrupts the mind-body connection and is marked by a pervasive sense of disembodiment and identity fragmentation. Symptoms stemming from untreated CSA tend to intensify over time, emphasizing the need for therapeutic interventions that address both psychological and physiological dimensions of trauma. Dance/movement therapy (DMT) offers a promising, body-centered approach that can help restore the mind-body connection, autonomy, and self-awareness disrupted by trauma. This review examines the potential of DMT to alleviate the neurobiological and emotional impacts of CSA-induced DDD and argues for its greater integration into trauma-informed treatment models. By targeting the embodied nature of dissociation, DMT may fill a critical gap in current therapeutic practices for this underdiagnosed and often misunderstood disorder.

It has been assumed that the excessive prescription of antibiotic medicines has produced antibacterial-resistant pathogenic bacterial populations. The growing concern about antibiotic- resistant bacteria has focused research efforts on naturally occurring phytochemicals. In addition to the traditional use of phytochemicals for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, these compounds have also been found to exhibit bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties. Research has revealed groups of bioactive compounds, termed secondary metabolites, that protect plants against environmental pathogens like herbivores, fungi, and bacteria. Groups of secondary metabolites have been found to inhibit bacterial growth, proving potential use as antibiotic medicines for humans in response to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Secondary metabolites like alkaloids and groups of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, have been isolated and tested for antibiotic properties in vitro. While phytochemicals individually display successful bacterial inhibition, combination therapies using secondary metabolites with currently distributed antibiotics seem to have synergistic bactericidal effects worth further research. The creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) is one plant that contains secondary metabolites that may serve as future antibiotic medicine for humans. Further development into the isolation of bioactive compounds can offer novel treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in humans.

Within the history of the archipelago, the Philippines has experienced generations of colonial presence, violence, and the loss of cultural identity. As a result, members of the Filipino community in the status quo may feel motivated to stifle their Filipino heritage out of shame and self-preservation, because the Philippines has historically been treated and perceived as inferior, or a means to an end. One of the ways that colonial mentality has manifested itself is in the skin whitening industry, in which products containing certain ingredients decrease the amount of melanin present in the skin. However, the skin whitening industry has become a public health crisis, disproportionately affecting women across the diaspora by establishing Eurocentric beauty standards. This interdisciplinary reflection will consider the disciplines of history, economics, and sociology to understand how colonial mentality within a Filipina experience has perpetuated itself, and help discover a path toward empowerment within personal ethnic identity.

Mindfulness involves focusing on the present moment with open-heartedness and non-judgmental awareness. Existing literature suggests that mindfulness is linked to reduced stress and improved well-being. This study investigates the relationship between mindfulness, locus of control, and stress in college students. The study, conducted at a Christian university, employs a correlational design with 126 undergraduate participants. Two Pearson’s r correlational analyses were used to assess the relation- ships between mindfulness and stress and mindfulness and locus of control. Results indicate a negative correlation between mindfulness and stress (r = -.414, p = <.001) and between mindfulness and locus of control (r = -.181, p = .043), supporting the hypothesis that higher levels of mindfulness relate to lower levels of stress and a stronger internal locus of control in college students. Limitations include the use of self-report measures and potential sampling bias from a single university. Future research should incorporate diverse samples from other universities and experimental designs to enhance generalizability and establish causation. The findings support the hypothesis and align with existing literature, emphasizing the potential benefits of mindfulness practices for stress reduction and the development of internal locus of control. Implications for mindfulness interventions to enhance students’ well-being are discussed, and avenues for future research are suggested. Jeremy Varnadore, Ashley Larson, Sean K.

For over twenty years, emergent bilingual students in Arizona have struggled under the state’s English-only policy. Despite the lack of research supporting its effectiveness in promoting English acquisition, this educational model continues to be enforced in Arizona classrooms. This reflections explores whether Arizona’s Proposition 203 was ever designed considering the “best interest” of Arizona’s emergent bilingual population or if its foundation was built under a false premise of “helping” to perpetuate specific ideals. Through this reflective piece, I bridge disciplinary boundaries by integrating theoretical frameworks across the disciplines of history, education, and psychology to examine the efficacy of Proposition 203 in addressing the complexities of language acquisition and the academic success of English Language Learners (ELLs). By drawing comparisons to other instructional methods employed in other unique student populations, this reflection provides a unique interdisciplinary perspective and a multifaceted approach that can help educators and policymakers address the current practices and existing programs impacting ELL students in Arizona.

The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast the behaviors and outcomes of modern leadership styles with that of DT leaders. The paper will also outline potential interventions for fixing adverse behaviors accompanying DT personality traits. When examining the literature, many authors comment on the effective and ineffective aspects of DT leadership, but they lack comprehensive interventions for dealing with leaders who exhibit DT personality traits and behaviors. It is of paramount importance to understand, intervene, and decrease these traits and behaviors in the workplace to boost the overall emotional, psychological, and physical safety of leaders, teams, and corporations. Exploring this could fuel more awareness of dark leader triads and potential interventions instead of merely exploring how these traits are exhibited in leadership or the workplace. This will enable more productivity and well-being in workplaces across the United States.

Current literature posits that accommodations for neurodivergent students in the education system are insufficient and ineffective (Nieminen, 2023). New models that focus on holistic accommodations have been proposed, integrating the teacher, fellow students, and the classroom environment into the neurodivergent learning process. These new holistic models were analyzed to understand them better and to ensure they match past and current research on neurodivergent populations. Most importantly, these models demonstrate the importance of individualizing instruction for each student, a practice strongly supported by current research. This paper also offers recommendations on how to fill the gaps in the current research, such as a lack of longitudinal studies. In addition, this paper recommends a new model for neurodivergent accommodation research called condition-specific individualization, which isa more effective framework for developing accommodation strategies. This model addresses accommodations and condition knowledge issues in classrooms attempting to accommodate neurodivergent students. Furthermore, this model recommends research into whether certain neurodivergent disorders are more receptive to certain forms of accommodation. Such research would allow for key individualization, while also recognizing that classrooms cannot always individualize to the degree recommended by current research. Through this analysis and these recommendations, this paper aims to create more effective neurodivergent accommodation models. Colin J. O’Reilly, Brynn E. Brunswig, Megan McConnell, Piper R.

Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation are all associated with this disease, and their interconnectivity in causing the development is still being investigated. The accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species from lipid peroxidation and macromolecule oxidation is thought to be responsible for oxidative stress’s effects. The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis suggests that amyloid beta plaques form due to the loss of mitochondrial function. This leads to abnormal expression of machinery involved with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and contributes to the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid β accumulation harms synapses and impairs neuronal transmission, causing neuronal pathway deterioration. Recent studies indicate that resveratrol, a polyphenol compound found in several plant species and fruits, may have therapeutic potential in treating Alzheimer’s disease by reducing oxidative stress and plaque pathology. Resveratrol is thought to inhibit several inflammatory and other neurotoxic pathways that serve to cause apoptosis and neuronal communication blockage in the CNS. However, additional research is necessary to fully comprehend the benefits of resveratrol and other polyphenols for Alzheimer’s disease treatment. Brayden J. Lamm, Jessica M. Buselmeier, Lorien R.

  { id: 1762395795954, title: "Deepfake Detection Via Facial Feature Extraction and Modeling – GCU Research", content: "The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while requiring fewer parameters.

  { id: 1762395853872, title: "The Great Commission: Effects of Evangelism on the Christian – GCU Research", content: "Upon engaging in several trips focusing on evangelism, I experienced an unexpected change. I noticed that after evangelizing, I had become significantly more compassionate and passionate about my faith. In order to discern the cause of these newfound changes, I looked at three theories to provide insight. The first theory focused on confirmation bias, the second on exposure, and the third on active faith. Using these three theories, I analyzed how witnessing someone convert to Christianity after sharing the Gospel with them could have brought about the unexpected changes. I concluded that while confirmation bias and exposure could have played a small role in my unexpected change, the most plausible explanation stemmed from employing active faith. Confirmation bias and exposure have evidence supporting them; however, I reasoned that they did not possess enough power to change my heart into one of compassion and zeal from the former one that was arrogant and complacent. The evidence seemed to support the idea that only a force as powerful as God could have brought about these unexpected changes. As a result of my reflection on my experience, my faith and confidence in God grew.

There are many factors in producing a successful transition program, but understanding barriers faced by student-athletes is the first step. These barriers may include negative stereotypes, mental health issues, physical burnout, and much more. Analyzing the sufficiency of current programs allows for future developments and improvements to be made while also acknowledging areas for improvement. Research on active programs is limited, but sufficient evidence exists to produce guidelines based on need. Recommendations are provided for coaches and support staff to assist student-athletes in their adjustment to college life, both in athletics and academics. The goal of these programs is not simply to elevate athletic performance during peak years of college, but to build skills in individuals which will translate to all areas of life, including careers after college.

Labor trafficking is embedded in the economy and our daily lives. While sex trafficking dominates headlines, labor trafficking fuels industries in ways we fail to see. From 2011 to 2022, 17 U.S. states reported no labor trafficking arrests, highlighting severe enforcement gaps and neglect in victim identification (Dominguez et al., 2024). Labor trafficking remains large and undetected due to misinformed public perceptions and a lack of victim identification training in law enforcement. This paper explores the often-overlooked issue of labor trafficking, using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates law, economics, and sociology. This approach highlights the gaps in current anti-trafficking policies and argues that addressing labor trafficking requires a shift from a criminal justice-centered response to a broader strategy, utilizing economics and sociology to implement victim support systems and economic deterrence in industries. By expanding the scope of anti-trafficking efforts to include greater support for law enforcement, alongside corporate accountability and victim protections, more sustainable solutions that protect vulnerable workers and disrupt exploitative systems can occur.

This literature review reveals that undocumented scholars pursuing a graduate education face a myriad of challenges stemming from their immigration status, which is followed by legal restrictions and financial hardships. The findings suggest that undocumented individuals encounter difficulties accessing financial aid at both state and federal levels. Undocumented individuals also face challenges as they seek internships, licensure, and employment within their field of study. These challenges impact academic achievement, long-term career prospects, and overall well-being.

It explores the history of mindfulness and theories of mindfulness, including self-determination theory, mindfulness-to-meaning theory, and dispositional mindfulness. The review examines mindfulness’s neurological, biological, psychological, and emotional impacts based on current research. It examines mindfulness interventions and their effectiveness in reducing stress in populations among students, working professionals, and clients undergoing clinical treatment. Studies show mindfulness can lower stress levels, though the impacts vary between populations. Mindfulness is also linked to improvements in behaviors, emotions, and well-being. Meditation practices, including meditation, yoga, and breathing techniques, positively affect biological, psychological, and emotional well-being. As mindfulness continues to expand in the realm of psychology, there is an ongoing opportunity for refining and enhancing interventions. Future research should evaluate the efficacy of novel mindfulness techniques and explore the application of mindfulness in previously unexplored populations, including college students.

As modern work environments continue to evolve, factors such as job insecurity, excessive job demands, and managerial influences have been identified as primary contributors to stress in the workplace. Research indicates that prolonged exposure to these stressors leads to adverse psychological and physical outcomes, decreased job satisfaction, and diminished career performance. Additionally, social factors, including peer relationships and organizational culture, are crucial in moderating stress levels among employees. While some studies suggest that moderate stress can enhance productivity in certain situations, chronic stress has been widely linked to burnout, reduced efficiency, and higher turnover rates. This literature review examines the relationship between workplace stress and job performance while also exploring evidence-based interventions designed to mitigate stress-related consequences. Strategies such as physical activity, mindfulness practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing stress and improving employee outcomes. However, gaps remain in the current research, particularly concerning the impact of workplace stress on blue-collar workers, self-report measures, longitudinal data, and the long-term sustainability of intervention programs. By synthesizing existing findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of workplace stress and its implications, offering insights into strategies that can enhance employee well-being and organizational effectiveness.

Despite the attempt to help address the barriers faced by this student population, the generalization of the term “first-gen” limits the capacity to grasp how specific identities, such as those pertaining to immigration status, may impact a student’s educational opportunities. Undocumented and DACA students face unique challenges in their pursuit of higher education. They often are more vulnerable to additional barriers and stressors due to the ambiguous nature surrounding immigration and education policy in the United States. Barriers for this subgroup of first-gen students include access to state and federal-based financial aid and in-state tuition rates, including a knowledge barrier in understanding the process of attaining post-secondary education. To help combat these obstacles, I developed programming under three overarching concepts: co-learning, supporting, and providing, which aimed to cultivate strong support systems and resources for student success. Thus, this community engagement profile focuses on how I addressed these barriers as the Immigrant Scholarship Hustle program fellow in my caseload of seven undocumented high school students through three applied methods, including student-parent orientation, educational workshops, and yearlong mentorship.

This interdisciplinary reflection builds on existing research about how social stigma affects treatment adherence for patients with bipolar disorder. This reflection examines the disciplines of sociology and psychology within the context of how these disciplines can be combined to improve treatment adherence and overall quality of life for these patients. Symbolic interactionism and cognitive behavioral theory are introduced to explore how social constructs influence behavior and thought processes, leading to non-adherence to traditional treatment methods. Through compiling scholarly research on current treatment adherence rates, treatment methods, relevant social factors, and cultural representations of psychiatric disorders, this reflection analyzes how these concepts affect bipolar disorder treatment. The results of this research indicate that many patients with bipolar disorder struggle to maintain their treatment due to a lack of internal motivation, which is often worsened by unsupportive environments and negative social experiences. These results demonstrate how combining disciplines can improve treatment adherence by integrating socially conscious methods like motivational interviewing and psychoeducation into current treatment. By continuing to increase awareness of the interdisciplinary approach among professionals to include both social and psychological aspects of treatment, the human element is reintroduced and allows the patient’s individual story to be heard.

Benefits include reduction of stress, anxiety, and other psychopathological symptoms. Additionally, mindfulness has positive effects on academic performance in the way that it enhances a student’s ability to sustain attention and retain information more efficiently. Literature on the adverse effects of mindfulness, such as retraumatization, delusions, and anxiety, are also mentioned to remove bias. With the growing popularity of mindfulness, this study aims to understand mindfulness within the contexts of education and faith. In hopes of integrating mindfulness practice into a Christian based university, we researched the benefits of mindfulness in educational settings ranging from primary to higher education, as well as mindfulness from the perspective of the Christian faith. Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of mindfulness for the Christian faith, but they do not incorporate education in their methods. To our knowledge, no conclusive study exists on the intersection between faith, education, and mindfulness.

Regular self-weighing can aid weight management but may also contribute to weight cycling (repeated weight loss and regain), which has negative health impacts. This study examined the relationship between weighing frequency and weight cycling in post-COVID college students. This was an observational, correlational study with 124 college students aged 18-30 years. Participants completed the Weight and Lifestyle Inventory questionnaire assessing weight history, including weight cycling (≥ 10lb weight change) and weighing frequency. Anthropometrics were measured. Statistical analysis included t-tests, correlations, and ANOVA. Results showed that participants averaged 1.2 ± 1.4 weight cycles. Males weighed themselves more frequently than females (p = 0.004). When analyzing both genders, there was a significant positive correlation between weighing frequency and the number of weight cycles (r = 0.293, p = 0.006), which remained for males (r = 0.409, p = 0.005) but not for females. Those weighing daily had significantly more weight cycles than less frequent weighers (p < 0.05). More frequent weighing was associated with greater weight cycling, particularly among males. This contradicts some prior research suggesting the benefits of regular self-weighing for weight control. Potential limitations include the observational design, self-reported data, and sample demographics. Future research could explore psychological factors and employ longitudinal designs to establish causality and develop tailored interventions.

Soy protein has shown success as a replacement for marine protein sources in CYT diets, reducing fishmeal levels, though concerns about potential intestinal inflammation persist with the inclusion of solvent-extracted soybean meal. To address this, processing strategies like fractionation, enzymatic treatment, heat treatment, and microbial fermentation have been employed to mitigate the negative impacts of soybean meal on fish nutrition and immune systems. This study focuses on optimizing soybean meal inclusion levels by incorporating advanced soy variants into CYT diets. The eight-week feeding trial, conducted in a recirculation system, featured six diets with sequential inclusion levels (0, 50, 100%) of high protein low oligosaccharide soybean meal (Bright Day, Benson Hill, St Louis, MO) and enzyme-treated soybean meal (HP 300, Hamlet Protein Inc., Findlay, OH), replacing solvent-extracted soybean. The study compares these formulations against a soy-free animal protein-based diet. At the end of the trial, fish were sampled for growth performance, body proximate composition, intestinal morphology, and immune response from gut samples. Results showed consistent FCR (P = 0.775), weight gain (P = 0.242), and high survival rate (99.4 ± 0.5%) among dietary treatments (P>0.05). Histological evaluations revealed no gut inflammation and gene expression analysis demonstrated no significant variations in immune, physiological, and digestive markers apn (P = 0.687), mga (P = 0.397), gpx1 (P = 0.279), atpase (P = 0.590), il1β (P = 0.659). The study concludes that incorporating advanced soybean meal products, replacing up to 20% of fishmeal does not negatively affect CYT’s growth and intestinal health. This suggests that all three soy sources, contributing 35% of total protein (15.4 g 100 g-1 diet), can be included in practical diets without compromising CYT’s intestinal integrity or growth. These findings have positive implications for the commercial production of CYT and future research on the incorporation of plant-based proteins in aquaculture diets. Abdulmalik A. Oladipupo, Kevin R.

The experiment spanned 171 days, encompassing decomposition stages from fresh to advanced decay. Soil samples were collected at regular intervals from four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west) and distances (0, 33, 66, and 100 cm) from the carcass to analyze changes in pH over time. Results indicated that decomposition significantly influenced soil pH, with the most dramatic changes occurring on the south side of the carcass, where the pig burst. pH levels generally increased near the carcass and decreased with distance. Linear regression analysis showed a statistically significant relationship (r² = 0.983, p < 0.05) between increasing distance and decreasing pH, confirming that the decomposition process caused measurable and consistent changes in soil chemistry. Environmental factors, such as temperature, moisture, and scavenger activity, also impacted the decomposition and subsequent changes in soil pH. These findings contribute valuable insights into the relationship between animal decomposition and soil chemistry, relevant to forensic and ecological studies. Although the collection period did not cover the entire decomposition process, the data provided meaningful results that can inform future taphonomic research.

The purpose of this research was to expose the model system Vibrio fischeri to simulated microgravity using the recently developed analog EagleStat, and measure production of AI via three cell-based biosensors (genetically modified microorganisms) that are able to detect long, medium and short chain Autoinducers after activation of gene expression of fluorescent markers. Our results show selective expression of Autoinducers after 24 or 48 hours of incubation. Medium and Short chain AIs are detected in higher quantities after 24 hours whereas long chain AIs are detected in higher quantity after both 24 and 48 hours of incubation. Although there is an observed tendency of a higher synthesis of AIs under Microgravity, our findings show that there is not a significant difference between Gravity and Microgravity conditions. These data are of great significance to decipher bacterial communication under stress conditions, and sheds light into future studies in an effort to elucidate bacterial responses to Microgravity.

A levee segment named Buck Chute Levee located in between Eagle Lake and the Mississippi River in Eagle Lake, MS is used in this research as a case study. Weather and soil field measurements at this levee have been collected a few years ago as part of a previous study on the levee. For the study presented in this report, the data collected from the period of June 2014 to May 2015 data was used. The weather data recorded included precipitation, temperature, humidity, average wind speed, and total solar radiation. We used the program SEEP/W which is a part of the GeoStudio suite to simulate the seepage flow and the pore water pressure (PWP) response within the levee embankment and, foundation soils to the boundary conditions, and the two bodies of water surrounding it; the Mississippi River and Eagle lake. Using the collected data, we created a LCI boundary condition that was applied to the embankment surface of the model to simulate the weather impact on the levee. The calibration of the seepage model was achieved by comparing the model total head results to the measurements of three piezometers installed on the landside of the levee. The major outcome of this research study is that the conventional use of the river and lake water level alone is not sufficient to predict the PWP in the levee embankment. LCI should be used in all transient seepage analyses to accurately predict accurate PWP.

Agriculture accounts for 70% of global fresh water usage. Technology must be developed to accommodate the increase of food production demanded by the growing global population and the subsequent increase in water usage. Aeroponic technology is a water-efficient vertical farming technology that can reduce water usage by 90% by suspending plant roots in air within a controlled chamber and supplying atomized droplets of a water-nutrient solution directly to the roots. This study simultaneously tests six droplet sizes of 10 𝜇m, 28 𝜇m, 46 𝜇m, 64 𝜇m, 82 𝜇m, and 100 𝜇m in an experimental aeroponic system by growing butterhead lettuce over a span of 12 days under controlled conditions. After conducting three experiments, the findings indicated that the droplet range of 64 𝜇m to 82 𝜇m experienced the most growth under the reported test conditions by evaluating the change in total length and change in number of leaves growing from the plant stem.

The setup included a tunable infrared diode laser, optical mirrors, photodiode-detectors, a beam-splitter, and a temperature- regulated rubidium gas chamber, all of which are controlled by the TeachSpin laser controller and monitor. The output from the laser-diode was split into a pump (90%) and a signal probe (10%), which intersected in counter-propagating directions inside the Rubidium chamber. The analysis shows that in the presence of the pump, the signal transmission increases significantly near the resonant transition frequency. This result demonstrates the non-linear interactions of the 2 laser beams inside the Rubidium chamber, which can be used to demonstrate quantum entanglement between 2 photons.

The impact on reproduction in female patients who are taking or have taken finasteride is unknown. Using drosophila melanogaster as a model, this study was designed to investigate the impact of finasteride on female fly reproduction and their offspring. The female flies in this study will be fed dosage equivalents of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg of finasteride, along with a control group of females who consume no finasteride. The flies will be allowed to mate after consuming their respective dose of the drug and the viable offspring will be counted over the next three days. If there are viable male offspring, they will be allowed to mate with female flies as well to determine if they are impacted by the drug. This study predicts the results will indicate the finasteride, especially at higher doses, will impact the reproductive ability of the females and their male offspring. These results will further the database that could lead to determining if finasteride could be used to treat the previously stated conditions in human females.

Through an analysis of various other material mitigation methods, it is apparent that the physical degradation of materials after they go through recycling processes and the cost of recycling are the most prominent issues holding the aerospace industry back from being able to recycle aircraft up to 100%. From a comparison of physical characteristics of materials after reprocessing, several materials were found to meet industry standards, while still being profitable, like poly ether ketone (PEEK) and aluminum. Not only is it necessary for material recycling methods to be improved to reduce the percentage of materials wasted, but the materials themselves. Regulations are closing in on materials that cause serious, long-term side effects on the environment and people. By using new manufacturing methods, these materials are strong enough to be candidates for structural components in the aircraft while also being safe to life long-term, however, the aerospace industry would need to be ready to change and work towards a similar goal.

This study aimed to measure the impact of aviation-related news announcements on the stock performance of US airlines, focusing on different topics. The dataset included aviation news covering airlines, airports, regulations, safety, accidents, manufacturers, MRO, incidents, aviation training, general aviation, and others obtained from Aviation Voice. To uncover patterns that could explain the movements of US airline stocks, a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed. The process involved text mining and topic modeling of the aviation-related data. The LDA model was then utilized to identify and capture specific topics mentioned in the news releases from Aviation Voice. By investigating the links between stock returns and the identified topics, the study revealed significant variations in financial performance across different topics. Notably, topics related to technology, fuel, and training positively impacted the short and long-term moving averages of US airline stocks. On the other hand, topics related to defense and travel costs only influenced the medium-term run. These findings shed light on the factors that influence US airline stock performance and provide valuable insights for investors and industry stakeholders. ssoufou Anaroua, Amina", author: "ssoufou Anaroua, Amina", ai_score: "Low", url: "https://commons.erau.edu/beyond/vol7/iss1/3/"},

Angular diameter measurements by VERITAS SII (VSII) in a waveband near 400 nm complement existing angular diameter measurements in the near-infrared. VSII observations will test fundamental predictions of stellar atmosphere models and should be more sensitive to limb darkening and gravity darkening effects than measurements in the near-IR, however, the magnitude of this difference has not been systematically explored in the literature. In order to investigate the synthetic interferometric (as well as spectroscopic) appearance of stars in the blue relative to the near-IR, we have computed grids of model atmospheres (3463 models in total) appropriate for six stars observed by VSII: four rapid rotators α Cep, α Leo, α Lyr, and η UMa, along with two slow rotators β UMa and β CMa. This paper presents synthetic spectra, model images, and visibility predictions for these stars and three others (α Aql, α Oph, and β Cas). We predict these stars will appear smaller in angular size and exhibit higher visibilities in the first lobe of the visibility curve at 400 nm relative to 1746 nm at the same spatial frequencies, consistent with our expectations. VSII baselines see only the second and higher lobes of α Lyr and α Aql due to their large angular diameters. α Aql is predicted to have a rich spectrum of visibilities in the third lobe, however, the visibilities are very low. Synthetic spectra match archival spectra around 400nm best for α Leo, α Aql, α Oph, β UMa and β CMa, while for α Cep, β Cas, and α Lyr synthetic spectra exhibit higher fluctuations in line strength than observed. A synthetic spectrum for η UMa provides a good match to the Hδ line, but not for the adjacent He I lines. In addition to resolving the discrepancies between the synthetic and archival spectra, we anticipate comparing our visibility predictions to VSII observations in the near future.

In public areas, the presence of a radioactive nuclide can present a risk to the population, and therefore, it is imperative that threats are identified by radiological search and response teams in a timely and effective manner. In urban environments, such as densely populated cities, radioactive sources may be more difficult to detect, since background radiation produced by surrounding objects and structures (e.g., buildings, cars) can hinder the effective detection of unnatural radioactive material. This article presents a computational model to detect radioactive sources in urban environments, which uses signal processing techniques to identify radiation signatures. Moreover, the model uses artificial neural networks to identify types of radiation sources, classifying them as innocuous or harmful, and discerning between weapons-grade material and radioactive isotopes used in medical or industrial settings.

Sending massive amounts of food into space is incredibly expensive, takes up valuable spacecraft area, and is, overall, not a feasible way to provide astronauts with sustenance. Project H.O.M.E. has thus developed a hydroponic system to evaluate the growth and yield of various superfoods - including Moringa Oleifera, goji berries, and kale - under simulated Mars lighting conditions. Data suggests that these three plants are perennial hydroponic crops, which can be grown under reduced illumination, and are candidate food sources for Mars explorers. Based on the hypothesis that the growth of the superfood plants in simulated lighting conditions will be similar to their growth in regular lighting conditions here on Earth, Project H.O.M.E. members created a Dutch bucket, tower garden, and nutrient flow table indoor hydroponics systems to grow superfoods in a solar-powered 8x16ft greenhouse for the past 13 months.

The dust that comprises the cloud comes from cometary, asteroidal, interstellar, and other source populations, but the relative ratios have proven hard to determine. However, asteroidal and cometary particles typically have different types of orbits, with asteroidal particles having more circular and lower inclination orbits than cometary particles. Accordingly, the relative velocities of these groups of particles with respect to Earth are also different, and measurements of these relative velocities can help distinguish between the sources. The spectrum of the zodiacal light contains solar absorption lines that are Doppler-shifted by moving dust particles. It is possible to determine dust particle velocities by observing the Doppler-shifted zodiacal light using the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper (WHAM) — a specialized Fabry-Perot spectrometer. Focusing on a pair of scattered solar Mg I Fraunhofer lines, we have recently begun a three-year observing campaign with WHAM. In order to interpret these observations we need to produce synthetic observations of how different orbital distributions of dust particles would shift and modify the observed spectral lines. Comparing these synthetic spectra to the actual observations will allow us to constrain the sources of the dust composing the zodiacal cloud.

However, whether interorganelle contact sites regulate this process is unknown. Recent studies have revealed a role for Calsyntenin-3β (CLSTN3β), an endoplasmic reticulum-lipid droplet contact site protein, in the control of lipid utilization in adipose tissue. Here, we show that Clstn3b expression is induced in the liver by the nuclear receptor PPARα in settings of high lipid utilization, including fasting and ketogenic diet feeding. Hepatocyte-specific loss of CLSTN3β in mice impairs ketogenesis independent of changes in PPARα activation. Conversely, hepatic overexpression of CLSTN3β promotes ketogenesis in mice. Mechanistically, CLSTN3β affects LD-mitochondria crosstalk, as evidenced by changes in fatty acid oxidation, lipid-dependent mitochondrial respiration, and the mitochondrial integrated stress response. These findings define a function for CLSTN3β-dependent membrane contacts in hepatic lipid utilization and ketogenesis.

Using gain- and loss-of-function systems, we find that markedly increasing SCAP-SREBP2 processing and resultant cholesterol synthesis has little impact on STING activity. In contrast, we find that genetic deletion of Srebf2 increased basal and ligand inducible type I IFN responses. Thus, STING can function in the absence of the SCAP-SREBP2 protein apparatus. Through activity-based protein profiling with three distinct sterol-mimetic probes, we provide direct evidence for STING-sterol binding. We also find that the mitochondrial protein VDAC1 co-purifies with STING and binds to sterol-mimetic probes. We also show that STING's subcellular localization is responsive to modulation of cellular sterol content. Our findings support a model where sterol synthesis in the ER regulates STING activity, aligning with recent studies indicating that cholesterol-mediated retention of STING in the endoplasmic reticulum occurs through cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CARC) motifs in STING.

While direct electron detection essentially eliminates the read-out noise during MicroED data collection, other sources of noise remain and limit the measurement of faint high-resolution reflections. Inelastic scattering significantly contributes to noise, raising background levels and broadening diffraction peaks. We demonstrate a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio by using energy filtering to remove inelastically scattered electrons. This strategy results in sub-atomic resolution MicroED data from proteinase K crystals, enabling the visualization of detailed structural features. Interestingly, reducing the noise further reveals diffuse scattering that may hold additional structural information. Our findings suggest that combining energy filtering and direct detection provides more accurate measurements at higher resolution, facilitating precise model refinement and improved insights into protein structure and function.

Despite decades of effort its structure and function remained elusive. Here, we determined the MicroED structure of full-length human MP20 in lipidic-cubic phase to a resolution of 3.5 Å. MP20 forms tetramers each of which contain 4 transmembrane α-helices that are packed against one another forming a helical bundle. We find that each MP20 tetramer formed adhesive interactions with an opposing tetramer in a head-to-head fashion. Investigation of MP20 localization in human lenses indicate that in young fiber cells MP20 is initially localized to the cytoplasm in differentiating fiber cells but upon fiber cell maturation is inserted into the plasma membrane, correlating with the restriction of the diffusion of extracellular tracers into the lens. Together these results suggest that MP20 forms lens thin junctions in vivo, confirming its role as a structural protein in the human eye lens essential for its optical transparency.

However, delivery of editing systems into plants remains challenging, often requiring slow, genotype-specific methods such as tissue culture or transformation1. Plant viruses, which naturally infect and spread to most tissues, present a promising delivery system for editing reagents. However, many viruses have limited cargo capacities, restricting their ability to carry large CRISPR-Cas systems. Here we engineered tobacco rattle virus (TRV) to carry the compact RNA-guided TnpB enzyme ISYmu1 and its guide RNA. This innovation allowed transgene-free editing of Arabidopsis thaliana in a single step, with edits inherited in the subsequent generation. By overcoming traditional reagent delivery barriers, this approach offers a novel platform for genome editing, which can greatly accelerate plant biotechnology and basic research.

Small molecule inhibitors are useful tools for studying caspase biology, complementary to genetic approaches. However, achieving inhibitor selectivity for individual members of this highly homologous enzyme family remains a major challenge in developing such tool compounds. Prior studies have revealed that one strategy to tackle this selectivity gap is to target the precursor or zymogen forms of individual caspases, which share reduced structural homology when compared to active proteases. To establish a screening assay that favors the discovery of zymogen-directed caspase-10 selective inhibitors, we engineered a low-background and high-activity tobacco etch virus (TEV)-activated caspase-10 protein. We then subjected this turn-on protease to a high-throughput screen of approximately 100 000 compounds, with an average Z' value of 0.58 across all plates analyzed. Counter screening, including against TEV protease, delineated bona fide procaspase-10 inhibitors. Confirmatory studies identified a class of thiadiazine-containing compounds that undergo isomerization and oxidation to generate cysteine-reactive compounds with caspase-10 inhibitory activity. In parallel, mode-of-action studies revealed that pifithrin-μ (PFTμ), a reported TP53 inhibitor, also functions as a promiscuous caspase inhibitor. Both inhibitor classes showed preferential zymogen inhibition. Given the generalized utility of activation assays, we expect our screening platform to have widespread applications in identifying state-specific protease inhibitors.

  { id: 1762902130969, title: "Recovering high-resolution information using energy filtering in MicroED.", content: "Inelastic scattering poses a significant challenge in electron crystallography by elevating background noise and broadening Bragg peaks, thereby reducing the overall signal-to-noise ratio. This is particularly detrimental to data quality in structural biology, as the diffraction signal is relatively weak. These effects are aggravated even further by the decay of the diffracted intensities as a result of accumulated radiation damage, and rapidly fading high-resolution information can disappear beneath the noise. Loss of high-resolution reflections can partly be mitigated using energy filtering, which removes inelastically scattered electrons and improves data quality and resolution. Here, we systematically compared unfiltered and energy-filtered microcrystal electron diffraction data from proteinase K crystals, first collecting an unfiltered dataset followed directly by a second sweep using the same settings but with the energy filter inserted. Our results show that energy filtering consistently reduces noise, sharpens Bragg peaks, and extends high-resolution information, even though the absorbed dose was doubled for the second pass. Importantly, our results demonstrate that high-resolution information can be recovered by inserting the energy filter slit. Energy-filtered datasets showed improved intensity statistics and better internal consistency, highlighting the effectiveness of energy filtering for improving data quality. These findings underscore its potential to overcome limitations in macromolecular electron crystallography, enabling higher-resolution structures with greater reliability.

Here, with the use of viral chimeras and evolutionary selection analysis, we define CHIKV glycoproteins E1 and E2 as critical for virion production in THP-1 derived human macrophages. Through proteomic analysis and functional validation, we further identify signal peptidase complex subunit 3 (SPCS3) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit K (eIF3k) as E1-binding host proteins with anti-CHIKV activities. We find that E1 residue V220, which has undergone positive selection, is indispensable for CHIKV production in macrophages, as its mutation attenuates E1 interaction with the host restriction factors SPCS3 and eIF3k. Finally, we show that the antiviral activity of eIF3k is translation-independent, and that CHIKV infection promotes eIF3k translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it associates with SPCS3. These functions of CHIKV glycoproteins late in the viral life cycle provide a new example of an intracellular evolutionary arms race with host restriction factors, as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Yet, understanding how genomic variation alters genome function to influence phenotype has proved challenging. To unlock these insights, we need a systematic and comprehensive catalogue of genome function and the molecular and cellular effects of genomic variants. Towards this goal, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium will combine approaches in single-cell mapping, genomic perturbations and predictive modelling to investigate the relationships among genomic variation, genome function and phenotypes. IGVF will create maps across hundreds of cell types and states describing how coding variants alter protein activity, how noncoding variants change the regulation of gene expression, and how such effects connect through gene-regulatory and protein-interaction networks. These experimental data, computational predictions and accompanying standards and pipelines will be integrated into an open resource that will catalyse community efforts to explore how our genomes influence biology and disease across populations.

These are largely attributed to X-ray-induced photoreduction. Here microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) is used to successfully unveil the experimental 3D structure of oxybutynin hydrochloride showing marked improvement over the reported PXRD structure. Using the improved model, molecular docking is applied to investigate the binding mechanism between M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R) and (R)-oxybutynin, revealing essential contacts/residues and conformational changes within the protein pocket. A possible universal conformation is proposed for M3R antagonists, which is valuable for future drug development and optimization.

This methylation erasure was completely blocked in the ros1 dml2 dml3 triple mutant lacking DNA demethylation enzymes, showing that H3K4me3 promotes the active removal of DNA methylation. Conversely, we found that the targeted removal of H3K4me3 increased the efficiency of targeted DNA methylation.

Interestingly, the effects of MOTS-c are tissue-specific. Systemically administered MOTS-c binds to CK2 in fat and muscle, yet stimulates CK2 activity in muscle while suppressing it in fat by differentially modifying CK2-interacting proteins. Notably, a naturally occurring MOTS-c variant, K14Q MOTS-c, has reduced binding to CK2 and does not activate it or elicit its effects. Male K14Q MOTS-c carriers exhibited a higher risk of sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in an age- and physical-activity-dependent manner, whereas females had an age-specific reduced risk of T2D.

The module includes a previsit asthma intake questionnaire via the portal. The parent answers are integrated into the provider's clinic progress note to support clinical decision-making. Our goals were to measure the functionality and usability of the PAC module and to understand facilitators and barriers to its use for parents. METHODS: Parents of children ages 0-11 years old (n = 45) completed the PAC module's asthma intake questionnaires prior to their upcoming pediatric pulmonology clinic visit. To assess functionality, provider progress notes were manually reviewed to measure the amount of key asthma-related data captured. Differences in percent data captured with and without the PAC module were compared. Electronic surveys capture demographics, usability data (the System Usability Scale [SUS]), and open-ended experiential feedback about the module. Analysis included descriptive statistics for demographics and usability, as well as the constant comparative method for open-ended feedback. RESULTS: The PAC module at this early stage of design significantly improved the capture of key asthma data in physician notes, increasing from 77% to 92% (p < 0.001). The average SUS score (83.8) indicated high usability. Favorable aspects of the module that were identified included time savings and ease of use. CONCLUSION: Our PAC module enhanced data capture of key asthma management elements and demonstrated high parental usability. We will continue to refine the module through an iterative approach based on end-user feedback, with future expansion planned for broader patient populations.

Clostripain is an arginine-specific endopeptidase. Because of its efficacy as a cysteine peptidase, it is widely used in laboratory settings. Despite its importance the structure of clostripain remains unsolved. Here we describe the first structure of an active form of C. histolyticum clostripain determined at 2.5 Å resolution using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). The structure was determined from a single nanocrystal after focused ion beam milling. The structure of clostripain shows a typical Clan CD α/β/α sandwich architecture and the Cys231/His176 catalytic dyad in the active site. It has a large electronegative substrate binding pocket showing its ability to accommodate large and diverse substrates. A loop in the heavy chain formed between residues 452 and 457 is potentially important for substrate binding. In conclusion, this result demonstrates the importance of MicroED to determine the unknown structure of macromolecules such as clostripain, which can be further used as a platform to study substrate binding and design of potential inhibitors against this class of peptidases.

Dihydromyricetin (DHM) bears chemical similarity to known natural product tau inhibitors. Despite having signature polyphenolic character, DHM is ostensibly hydrophobic owing to intermolecular hydrogen bonds that shield hydrophilic phenols. Our research shows DHM becomes ionized at near-neutral pH, allowing the formulation of salts with transformed solubility. The MicroED co-crystal structure with trolamine reveals DHM salts as metastable co-crystalline solids with unlocked hydrogen bonding and a thermodynamic bent to solubilize in water. All co-crystal formulations show better inhibitory activity against AD tau than the nonsalt form, with efficacies correlating to enhanced solubilities. In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic measures demonstrate that DHM co-crystals display enhanced absorption and distribution with altered rates of elimination, suggesting that co-crystal formulations could be strategically used to fine-tune delivery properties. These results underscore the role of structural chemistry in guiding the selection of solubilizing agents for chemical formulation. We propose DHM co-crystals are appropriate formulations for research as dietary supplements to promote healthy aging by combating protein misfolding, although central nervous system (CNS) delivery remains a major limitation. DHM may be a suitable backbone for medicinal chemistry and possible development of pharmaceuticals with enhanced CNS exposure.

However, despite their ubiquity, nearly all acquired cysteines remain unidentified via chemoproteomics; identification is a critical step to enable functional analysis, including assessment of potential druggability and susceptibility to oxidation. Here, we pair cysteine chemoproteomics-a technique that enables proteome-wide pinpointing of functional, redox sensitive, and potentially druggable residues-with genomics to reveal the hidden landscape of cysteine genetic variation. Our chemoproteogenomics platform integrates chemoproteomic, whole exome, and RNA-seq data, with a customized two-stage false discovery rate (FDR) error controlled proteomic search, which is further enhanced with a user-friendly FragPipe interface. Chemoproteogenomics analysis reveals that cysteine acquisition is a ubiquitous feature of both healthy and cancer genomes that is further elevated in the context of decreased DNA repair. Reference cysteines proximal to missense variants are also found to be pervasive, supporting heretofore untapped opportunities for variant-specific chemical probe development campaigns. As chemoproteogenomics is further distinguished by sample-matched combinatorial variant databases and is compatible with redox proteomics and small molecule screening, we expect widespread utility in guiding proteoform-specific biology and therapeutic discovery.

We previously reported that the functional and molecular profiles of layer 2/3 (L2/3) cell types in the primary visual cortex (V1) are vision-dependent [S. Cheng et al., Cell 185, 311-327.e24 (2022)]. Here, we characterize the spatial organization of L2/3 cell types with and without visual experience. Spatial transcriptomic profiling based on 500 genes recapitulates the zonation of L2/3 cell types along the pial-ventricular axis in V1. By applying multitasking theory, we suggest that the spatial zonation of L2/3 cell types is linked to the continuous nature of their gene expression profiles, which can be represented as a 2D manifold bounded by three archetypal cell types. By comparing normally reared and dark reared L2/3 cells, we show that visual deprivation-induced transcriptomic changes comprise two independent gene programs. The first, induced specifically in the visual cortex, includes immediate-early genes and genes associated with metabolic processes. It manifests as a change in cell state that is orthogonal to cell-type-specific gene expression programs. By contrast, the second program impacts L2/3 cell-type identity, regulating a subset of cell-type-specific genes and shifting the distribution of cells within the L2/3 cell-type manifold. Through an integrated analysis of spatial transcriptomics with single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we describe how vision patterns cortical L2/3 cell types during the critical period.

  { id: 1763447869284, title: "SE(3)-equivariant ternary complex prediction towards target protein degradation", content: "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has rapidly emerged as a powerful modality for drugging previously “undruggable” proteins. TPD employs small molecules like PROTACs and molecular glue degraders (MGD) to induce target protein degradation via the formation of a ternary complex with an E3 ligase. However, the rational design of these degraders is severely hindered by the difficulty of obtaining these ternary structures. Here we introduce DeepTernary, a novel end-to-end deep learning approach using an SE(3)-equivariant encoder and a query-based decoder to accurately and rapidly predict these critical structures. Trained on carefully curated TernaryDB, DeepTernary achieves state-of-the-art performance on PROTAC benchmarks without prior exposure to known PROTACs and shows notable prediction capability on the more challenging MGD benchmark with a blind docking protocol. Remarkably, the buried surface areas calculated from predicted structures correlate with experimental degradation potency metrics. Overall, DeepTernary offers a powerful tool for the development of targeted protein degraders.

The three-dimensional (3D) structure of fluticasone furoate 1 remains unpublished, and the deposited structure of fluticasone propionate 2 could be further refined due to refinement against new data. We applied microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the 3D structures of 1 and 2 in their solid states. The preferred geometries in solution were predicted by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A comparative analysis of the structures of 1 and 2 across three states (in solid state, in solution, and protein-bound conformation) revealed the course of the conformational changes during the entire transition. Potential energy plots were calculated for the most dynamic bonds, uncovering their rotational barriers. This study underscores the combined use of MicroED and DFT calculations to provide a comprehensive understanding of conformational and energy changes during drug administration. The quantitative comparison also highlights the subtle structural differences that may lead to significant changes in the pharmaceutical properties.

Instead, these SCCs were metabolically flexible and sustained growth through glutaminolysis, another metabolic process frequently implicated to fuel tumorigenesis in various cancers. Here, we focused on glutaminolysis and genetically blocked this process through glutaminase (GLS) deletion in SCC cells of origin. Genetic deletion of GLS had little effect on tumorigenesis due to the up-regulated lactate consumption and utilization for the TCA cycle, providing further evidence of metabolic flexibility. We went on to show that posttranscriptional regulation of nutrient transporters appears to mediate metabolic flexibility in this SCC model. To define the limits of this flexibility, we genetically blocked both glycolysis and glutaminolysis simultaneously and found the abrogation of both of these carbon utilization pathways was enough to prevent both papilloma and frank carcinoma.

Here we investigated the epigenomic and three-dimensional chromatin conformational reorganization during the development of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, using more than 53,000 joint single-nucleus profiles of chromatin conformation and DNA methylation generated by single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (snm3C-seq3)3. The remodelling of DNA methylation is temporally separated from chromatin conformation dynamics. Using single-cell profiling and multimodal single-molecule imaging approaches, we have found that short-range chromatin interactions are enriched in neurons, whereas long-range interactions are enriched in glial cells and non-brain tissues. We reconstructed the regulatory programs of cell-type development and differentiation, finding putatively causal common variants for schizophrenia strongly overlapping with chromatin loop-connected, cell-type-specific regulatory regions. Our data provide multimodal resources for studying gene regulatory dynamics in brain development and demonstrate that single-cell three-dimensional multi-omics is a powerful approach for dissecting neuropsychiatric risk loci.

  { id: 1763448202550, title: "Double assurance in the induction of axial development by egg dorsal determinants in Xenopus embryos", content: "We recently reported that microinjection of Xenopus nodal-related (xnr) mRNAs into β-catenin-depleted Xenopus embryos rescued a complete dorsal axis. Xnrs mediate the signal of the Nieuwkoop center that induces the Spemann-Mangold organizer in the overlying mesoderm, a process inhibited by the Nodal antagonist Cerberus-short (CerS). However, β-catenin also induces a second signaling center in the dorsal prospective ectoderm, designated the Blastula Chordin and Noggin Expression (BCNE) center, in which the homeobox gene siamois (sia) plays a major role. In this study, we asked whether the Xnrs and Sia depend on each other or function on parallel pathways. Expression of both genes induced β-catenin-depleted embryos to form complete axes with heads and eyes via the activation of similar sets of downstream organizer-specific genes. Xnrs did not activate siamois, and, conversely, Sia did not activate xnrs, although both were induced by β-catenin stabilization. Depletion with morpholinos revealed a robust role for the downstream target Chordin. Remarkably, Chordin depletion prevented all ectopic effects resulting from microinjection of the mRNA encoding the maternal cytoplasmic determinant Huluwa, including the radial expansion of brain tissue and the ectopic expression of the ventral gene sizzled. The main conclusion was that the BCNE and Nieuwkoop centers provide a double assurance mechanism for axial formation by independently activating similar downstream transcriptional target gene repertoires. We suggest that Siamois likely evolved from an ancestral Mix-type homeodomain protein called Sebox as a Xenopus-specific adaptation for the rapid differentiation of the anterior neural plate in the ectoderm.

Patients’ Perceptions of Corrective Experiences in Individual Therapy (PPCEIT; Constantino, Angus, Friedlander, Messer, & Heatherington, 2011) semistruc- tured interviews were completed at therapy termination with 1 MI–CBT client and 1 CBT-only client who met the criteria for recovery. The PPCEIT interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and subjected to a grounded theory analysis using qualita- tive research methods software (ATLAS.ti). Findings indicated that both clients re- ported positive shifts in their experience of anxiety and increased agency in interper- sonal relationships. In particular, the client undergoing integrative MI–CBT treatment reported increased confidence in her own ability to maintain positive changes post- therapy, while the CBT-only client expressed confidence in her application of CBT tools and skills to maintain therapy outcomes. The MI–CBT client attributed the shifts she experienced in therapy to an increased awareness and confidence in her own agency, indicating a potential corrective experience of self, whereas the CBT-only client attributed the positive shifts she experienced to the expertise provided by the therapist.

Although family involvement in mental health care is increasing in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system, little is known about family members’ preferences for services. This study elicited the perspec- tives of returning Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder and their families regarding family involvement in veterans’ mental health care. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 47 veterans receiving care for posttraumatic stress disorder at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System or Oklahoma City VA Medical Center and 36 veteran-designated family members. Interviews addressed perceived needs related to veterans’ readjustment to civilian life, interest in family involvement in joint veteran/family programs, and desired family program content. Interview data were analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison. Both groups strongly supported inclusion of family members in programs to facilitate veterans’ postdeployment readjustment and reintegration into civilian life. Both desired program content focused on information, practical skills, support, and gaining perspective on the other’s experience. Although family and veteran perspectives were similar, family members placed greater emphasis on parenting-related issues and the kinds of support they and their children needed during and after deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first published report on preferences regarding VA postdeployment reintegration support that incorporates the perspectives of returning male and female veterans and those of their families.

The majority of psychologists have been trained in a scientist-practitioner model to both utilize and produce scientific research. However, the day-to-day integration of research and clinical practice is rare for most psychologists. Changes in the health care system, increased emphasis on evidence-based practices, diminished funding for psychosocial research, and decreases in tenure track faculty positions mean that new models are needed for both clinical practice and research productivity. Although this rapidly changing professional landscape poses significant challenges, these changes may also create new opportunities to fulfill the ideal of an integrated psychological science. Some fee-for-service settings could be restructured based on social business models to promote research productivity among clinicians, improve clinical outcomes, and provide a new home for psychological researchers who would like their work to be more connected to the applied aspects of their science. In this paper, we outline some of the reasons why, to this point, psychosocial research has never occurred in a robust fashion in private fee-for-service settings. We then outline some potential ways of overcoming barriers to conducting research outside of academia, including how to carve out and fund dedicated research time within a clinical practice setting. Finally, we provide a case example of a new business model to support this research, called the clinical-research social business model, in which profits from the income-generating activities of the business serve as a stable, internal funding source for in-house research endeavors.; Keywords: scientist-practitioner, social business model, practice-based research, business Jenna T.

Few if any studies have examined the role of gratitude in heart failure (HF) patients or whether it is a mechanism through which spirituality may exert its beneficial effects on physical and mental health in this clinical population. This study examined associations between gratitude, spiritual well-being, sleep, mood, fatigue, cardiac-specific self- efficacy, and inflammation in 186 men and women with Stage B asymptomatic HF (age 66.5 years  10). In correlational analysis, gratitude was associated with better sleep (r  .25, p  .01), less depressed mood (r  .41, p  .01), less fatigue (r  .46, p  .01), and better self-efficacy to maintain cardiac function (r  .42, p  .01). Patients expressing more gratitude also had lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers (r  .17, p  .05). We further explored relationships among these variables by examining a putative pathway to determine whether spirituality exerts its beneficial effects through gratitude. We found that gratitude fully mediated the relationship between spiritual well-being and sleep quality (z  2.35, SE  .03, p  .02) and also the relationship between spiritual well-being and depressed mood (z  4.00, SE  .075, p  .001).

Family environment, as indexed by parental expressed emotion, may moderate these trajectories. 388 children with ADHD and 127 controls were assessed using multi-informant, multim- ethod diagnostic procedures at up to 3 time points 1 year apart in an accelerated longitudinal design spanning ages 7–13 years. Latent-class growth analysis was used to identify developmental trajectories for parent- and teacher-rated ADHD and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms within the ADHD sample. Parental expressed emotion, criticism, and emotional overinvolvement were coded from a 5-min speech sample at 2 time points, 1 year apart, for 208 of these children and compared among ADHD trajectory groups. Results: Parent-rated hyperactivity yielded a 4-class trajectory solution in latent-class growth analysis; teacher-rated inattention yielded a 3-trajectory solution. Teacher-rated ODD also yielded 3-trajectory solution. A parent- rated high persistent hyperactive group was more likely than the other ADHD groups to have parents with stable high criticism (34.6%, p  .001), with ODD symptoms controlled. A teacher-identified high ODD- worsening group was more likely to experience high criticism, particularly the initial time point; (87.5%, p  .001), with hyperactivity controlled. Parental criticism, an index of the family environment, is uniquely associated with divergent developmental trajectories among children with ADHD in addition to those associated with ODD symptoms.
